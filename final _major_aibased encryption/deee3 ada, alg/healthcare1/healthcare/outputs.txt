## 1. AI-Based Encryption and Decryption

**Description:** The system uses AI-driven encryption methods to secure sensitive healthcare data, including text fields and uploaded files. Decryption occurs automatically when data is accessed by authorized users.

**Output Locations:**

*   **Encrypted Text Data (Database):**
    *   **Location:** Stored directly within the database in specific fields of the `Appointment`, `Diagnosis`, and `Prescription` models.
    *   **Details:**
        *   `patients/models.py`:
            *   `Appointment` model: `encrypted_data` field (stores encrypted `symptoms`, `preferred_date`, `preferred_time`).
            *   `Diagnosis` model: `encrypted_data` field (stores encrypted `diagnosis_text`, `notes`).
            *   `Prescription` model: `encrypted_data` field (stores encrypted `text`).
    *   **Access:** When these fields are retrieved and displayed in the application, the `EncryptedTextField` automatically decrypts the content.

*   **Encrypted Files (File System):**
    *   **Location:** Files are encrypted before being saved to the file system.
    *   **Details:**
        *   **Prescription Files:** `c:\Users\SESA837127\Downloads\deee3 ada, alg\healthcare1\healthcare\media\prescriptions\`
        *   **Lab Result Files:** `c:\Users\SESA837127\Downloads\deee3 ada, alg\healthcare1\healthcare\media\lab_results\`
    *   **Access:** The `EncryptedFileField` handles the encryption/decryption of these files during upload and retrieval.

*   **Encryption/Decryption Debug Logs:**
    *   **Location:** `c:\Users\SESA837127\Downloads\deee3 ada, alg\healthcare1\healthcare\encryption_debug.log`
    *   **Details:** This file contains detailed logs of encryption and decryption operations, including timestamps, methods used, and any potential errors or informational messages.

## 2. Anomaly Detection

**Description:** An AI model monitors system behavior or data patterns to detect anomalies, which could indicate security threats or unusual activity.

**Output Locations:**

*   **Anomaly Detection Model:**
    *   **Location:** `c:\Users\SESA837127\Downloads\deee3 ada, alg\healthcare1\healthcare\ai_entropy_model.pkl`
    *   **Details:** This is the serialized Python object (a scikit-learn model) that performs the anomaly detection.
    *   **Related:** `c:\Users\SESA837127\Downloads\deee3 ada, alg\healthcare1\healthcare\ai_entropy_model_scaler.pkl` (likely a scaler used for preprocessing data for the anomaly model).

*   **Anomaly Detection Logs/Results:**
    *   **Location:** `c:\Users\SESA837127\Downloads\deee3 ada, alg\healthcare1\healthcare\encryption_debug.log`
    *   **Details:** Look for log entries with `anomaly_detector` indicating when the model starts training, when anomalies are detected, or any scores generated.
    *   **Potential Database Storage:** Depending on implementation, anomaly flags or scores might be stored in relevant database models (e.g., `User` or `Profile` models) if an anomaly is associated with a specific entity. (Further investigation needed to confirm specific database fields).

## 3. Adaptive Algorithm Selection

**Description:** An AI model dynamically selects the most appropriate encryption algorithm based on various factors (e.g., data sensitivity, device capabilities, threat landscape).

**Output Locations:**

*   **Adaptive Algorithm Selector Model:**
    *   **Location:** `c:\Users\SESA837127\Downloads\deee3 ada, alg\healthcare1\healthcare\ai_algorithm_selector.pkl`
    *   **Details:** This is the serialized Python object (a scikit-learn model, likely a RandomForestClassifier as seen in the file content) responsible for making algorithm selection decisions.

*   **Algorithm Selection Logs:**
    *   **Location:** `c:\Users\SESA837127\Downloads\deee3 ada, alg\healthcare1\healthcare\encryption_debug.log`
    *   **Details:** Look for log entries indicating when an algorithm is selected, the criteria used, and the chosen algorithm.

*   **Algorithm Strength Predictor Model:**
    *   **Location:** `c:\Users\SESA837127\Downloads\deee3 ada, alg\healthcare1\healthcare\ai_strength_predictor.pkl`
    *   **Details:** This model likely predicts the strength or suitability of different algorithms, informing the adaptive selector.

## 4. ECC Private and Public Key Exchange

**Description:** Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is used for secure key exchange, ensuring that symmetric encryption keys can be securely shared between parties (e.g., patient and doctor).

**Output Locations:**

*   **Key Storage (Database):**
    *   **Location:** Keys are typically stored in the database, associated with user profiles or specific entities.
    *   **Details:**
        *   `security/fields.py`: The `EncryptedTextField` and `EncryptedFileField` rely on recipient keys. The `recipient_field_name='patient.profile'` suggests that keys are associated with user profiles.
        *   You would need to inspect `users/models.py` (specifically the `Profile` model) to find fields that store public keys, private keys (encrypted), or key identifiers for users.
        *   `patients/models.py`: The `Appointment` model previously had `aes_key_encrypted_with_ecc` fields (now removed in migration `0006`), indicating that symmetric keys were exchanged and stored encrypted using ECC. The current `encrypted_data` fields imply that the symmetric key used for that specific data block is either derived or exchanged and used on the fly, or stored within the encrypted blob itself.
    *   **Key Exchange Process:** The actual key exchange happens dynamically during encryption/decryption, leveraging the stored public/private keys.

*   **Key Exchange Logs:**
    *   **Location:** `c:\Users\SESA837127\Downloads\deee3 ada, alg\healthcare1\healthcare\encryption_debug.log`
    *   **Details:** Look for log entries related to key generation, key exchange, key retrieval, and any cryptographic operations involving ECC.
